# Project Overview: Modern Clothiers

Modern Clothiers is a premium, framework-less web application designed for a modern clothing brand. It features a bold, high-contrast aesthetic with neon green accents on a dark, immersive background.

## Current Features & Design

### Aesthetics
- **Theme:** Dark Mode with Neon Green (`#25ff14`) accents.
- **Face-Free Aesthetic:** Focuses exclusively on clothing and footwear. Product imagery and the site-wide fixed background are strictly face-free for a minimalist look.
- **Hero Section:** Features a stylish back-view of an individual wearing brand apparel, set against a fixed background for a parallax-like feel.
- **Scrolling Effect:** Sections (Products, Affiliate, Comments) feature a semi-transparent background with a glassmorphism blur, allowing the fixed site-wide background to show through as the user scrolls.
- **Typography:** 'Montserrat' for headings and 'Poppins' for body text.

### Components
- **Navigation Bar:** Sticky header with integrated search and a sleek cart status pill.
- **Shopping Cart Modal:** Fully functional cart management system.
- **Product Grid:** 10 premium items (clothes and shoes) priced between $50.00 and $80.00.
- **Customer Feedback:** Integrated Disqus comment thread.
- **Professional Footer:** Comprehensive site information and links.

## Technical Implementation
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, Modern JavaScript (ES Modules, Custom Elements, Shadow DOM).
- **Attributes Handling:** Refactored `ProductCard` to use `connectedCallback` for reliable data rendering and to prevent 'null' values.
- **External Integrations:** Disqus, Formspree, Icons8, Unsplash.

## Recent Changes (February 27, 2026)
- **Imagery Refinement:** Replaced images 4, 5, and 9 with product-only shots. Removed redundant items 11 and 12.
- **Hero Update:** Set the main hero background to a high-quality back-view fashion photo.
- **Scrolling Effect:** Implemented a fixed background with transparent sections to create a dynamic scrolling experience.
- **GitHub Sync:** All latest changes pushed to the repository.
